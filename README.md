Topic – Autonomous Robotic Wall Painting Machine

Abstract:-
Today humans out perform robots in problem solving, adaptability, and creativity. The goal of this project was to bridge the gap between robotic and human capabilities through the development of an autonomous painting robot. The custom design of the mechanics, electronics, and software allowed for a versatile solution. Understanding the motions undertaken by painters and replicating it in a robotic platform can revolutionize the art form, contribute to the scientiﬁc advancement of robotic capabilities, and reduce the workload needed to construct paintings.


Introduction:-
Ever wondered if a robot could make painting and arts?  So here, the idea is to make a robot that takes input that is image or picture from the user and paint it on the respective wall surface . This project helps artists to do there task more efficiently and keep them safe from harmful chemicals needed for painting.  


Problem Statement:-
There are many unknowns, such as the amount of paint on the brush , effect of mixing paint on the wall.
Professional painters use various tools and techniques. To replicate such painters, the robot must be able to physically change between various tools.


Literature Survey:-
This are the approach which helps to complete my project.

--The idea of an autonomous wall painting robot consists of an arm that scans the walls vertically and is fitted on a mobile robot base to give the lateral feed motion to cover the painting area. Ultrasonic sensors are contoured on the arm and the mobile base to adjust the motion limits and maneuver in the room area.
--The use of IR transmitter and IR receiver to detect the presence of a wall. DC motor movements are controlled by microcontroller.
--The idea of interior wall painting and designing the robot, that is capable of identifying the roughness of the surface, which is to be painted, to reduce the wastage of paint.
--The Arduino in it is used to control the DC motor and the moment of spray gun fitted on the slider.


Hardware and software requirements:-
1)Raspberry Pi 3
2)Ultrasonic Sensors 
3)DC Motor
4) Raspberry Pi Camera 
5)Servo Motor 
6)Spray can
7)PMD Machine Control Board
8)Force Sensor
9)Robot wheels 
10)Raspbian JESSIE 
11)Python 3.5
12)Graphical user interface(GUI) was created. This GUI was made using wxPython, a cross-platform python library.


Challenge:-
1 if the power cut happens then, after getting power again the painting should start from the point it got stopped.
2 understanding the surface of the wall and using the suitable paint .
